# Spring Framework Study Progress

I have completed a comprehensive study on the foundational concepts of the Spring Framework, focusing on Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), along with related annotations and configurations. Below is a summary of the topics covered:

1. **Introduction to the Course**
   - Overview of the course content and objectives.

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
   - Preparation of the development environment for Spring projects.

3. **Creating a Project with Maven**
   - Step-by-step guide on creating a new Maven project.

4. **Inversion of Control (IoC) - Part 1**
   - Introduction to IoC and its importance in Spring.

5. **Inversion of Control (IoC) - Part 2**
   - Deep dive into IoC concepts and implementation.

6. **Introduction to Dependency Injection (DI)**
   - Basics of DI and how it simplifies object creation and management.

7. **Constructor-based Dependency Injection**
   - Implementing DI using constructors.

8. **Setter-based Dependency Injection**
   - Implementing DI using setter methods.

9. **Injecting Strings and Other Values**
   - Techniques for injecting literal values.

10. **Injecting Values from Properties File**
    - Injecting values from an external properties file.

11. **Quick Recap of IoC and DI**
    - Summary of IoC and DI concepts.

12. **Bean Scope**
    - Understanding different bean scopes in Spring.

13. **Init and Destroy Methods**
    - Lifecycle methods for initializing and destroying beans.

14. **Configuration using Annotations**
    - Using annotations for bean configuration.

15. **@Autowired Annotation for Constructor**
    - Using `@Autowired` with constructors.

16. **@Autowired Annotation for Setter**
    - Using `@Autowired` with setter methods.

17. **@Autowired Annotation for Field**
    - Using `@Autowired` with fields.

18. **@Qualifier Annotation**
    - Using `@Qualifier` to resolve bean conflicts.

19. **@Value Annotation**
    - Injecting property values using `@Value`.

20. **@Scope, @PostConstruct, and @PreDestroy Annotations**
    - Using `@Scope`, `@PostConstruct`, and `@PreDestroy` annotations.

21. **Configuration with Java Code - Method 1**
    - Java-based configuration approach.

22. **Configuration with Java Code - Method 2**
    - Another method for Java-based configuration.

23. **@PropertySource Annotation**
    - Using `@PropertySource` to load external properties files.

This structured learning path has provided me with a solid understanding of the core concepts and practical implementation of Spring Framework features.
